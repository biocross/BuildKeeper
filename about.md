**Librarian** is an open-source project which allows mobile app development teams to locally host their builds and enable easy testing & sharing of their apps.

#### Features
* **Locally Hosted**: No more slow downloads / waiting for Testflight processing / worry about third party services disrupting your release schedule.
* **Public URLs**: Accessible by your entire team through localhost tunneling.
* **iOS & Android Support**: Cross platform support makes it a great choice for all teams.

#### Contributing
Librarian is built of two parts: 
* [Librarian](https://github.com/biocross/Librarian) - The Command Line tool written in NodeJS.
* [Librarian Web](https://github.com/biocross/Librarian-Web) - The Web Interface of Librarian (which you're reading this on :) built in Jekyll.

Please feel free to head over to github to contribute to Librarian!
